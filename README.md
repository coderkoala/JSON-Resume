## Description
This template was built using AngularJS. It includes a custom modal component using CSS animations, which can be used to display further information at some sections. Feel free to modify and/or use it in any way you like. It also uses Gulp for as a build system and all developer dependencies can be found in the package.json file.

 2. Install all development dependencies by opening the command line in the project root folder and running the command ````npm install````.
 3. Make sure you have Gulp globally installed (````npm install --global gulp-cli````) and then run the following task in the command line to build the project files in the project's root folder: ````gulp build````.
 4. Finally, to view the template you will have to run lite-server. Lite-server is installed as a development dependency so all you need to do is run ````npm start```` in the command line.
